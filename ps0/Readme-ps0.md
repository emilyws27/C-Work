# PS0: Hello SFML

## Contact
Name: Emily Sheehan
Section: 1
Time to Complete: 40 minutes (excluding Linux installation)


## Description
Explain what the project is supposed to do
The project allows the user to move around a sprite bottle and increase/decrease its size. This is accomplished using the arrow keys and the period (increase) and comma (decrease keys). It also displays a magenta octagon in the upper left hand corner.

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
I chose to wrap steps 2 and 3 into one function by allowing the user to move the sprite with the keys. I used the sf::Keyboard library to handle key presses because we were already using this library for the project. I handled the key presses using cases in order to distinguish between which key was pressed. For the additional feature, I chose to incorporate a size scaler for the sprite because I had to scale the sprite's size to begin with in order to fit in the screen, so it was an easy addition. I also swapped the green circle for a magenta octagon because the I wanted to change up the color pallet after using a primarily green sprite bottle and change it up from a circle.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
I think everything works.

### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.
I am not sure if my "extensions" fall under step 4 or they may be too simple to count for EC, but I changed the circle, added two key bindings (period and comma), and changed the title of the window to "Emily's Project 0"

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

I think example 7 (Assists other students in any of these acts) is most likely to occur because most people are inclined to help others' out, especially friends. Most of the time, it probably is not of malicious intent like examble (a), and the culprit is doing it out of genuine goodwill and care for the person receiving. That being said, when up against tight deadlines and busy schedules, people may make deals and say if you do every even numbered homework, I'll do the odd numbered, or something similar. Furthermore, people are terrified of failing. Most would rather cheat than be honest and turn something in late. Everyone has been in that position before, when they are running up against the clock, and using someone else's work may seem like an easy way to save time and still get a good grade. For such reasons, I believe that example 7 is likely to occur.
