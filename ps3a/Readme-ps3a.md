# PS3a: N-Body Simulation

## Contact
Name: Emily Sheehan
Section: 1
Time to Complete: 6 Hours


## Description
This project displays a "universe" and the celestial bodies within that universe to scale. 

### Features
The universe consists of celestial body objects whose data is read in from a command line-provided txt file provided by the user. The celestial bodies are then created and displayed by performing dimensional analysis, converting the x_position of the celestial body from the scale of the universe to the scale of the window. Once all celestial objects are displayed, the background galaxy image is loaded too. 
### Memory
Yes, in my celestial body vector inside of the universe, I used pointers to such objects instead of celestial bodies themselves. 

### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
I think everything works. I had a lot of trouble defining the classes and figuring out which information should be in which class. I was also confused by the drawable, and I did not realize that it needed to be extended in both the Universe and the Celestial Body class. 

### Extra Credit
I added a background image
